## Turn on debug options in the kernel configuration!

During the development phase, do yourself a favour: turn on
`CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ_PIPELINE` and `CONFIG_DEBUG_DOVETAIL`.

The first one will catch many nasty issues, such as calling unsafe
in-band code from out-of-band context. The second one checks the
integrity of the alternate task control mechanism, detecting issues in
the architecture port.

The runtime overhead induced by enabling these options is
marginal. Just don't port Dovetail or implement out-of-band client
code without them enabled in your target kernel, seriously.

## Serialize stages when accessing shared data

If some writable data is shared between in-band and out-of-band code,
you have to guard against out-of-band code preempting or racing with
the in-band code which accesses the same data. This is required to
prevent dirty reads and dirty writes:

- one the same CPU, by [disabling interrupts in the CPU]({{% relref
  "pipeline/usage/interrupt_protection.md#hard-irq-protection" %}}).

- from different CPUs, by using [hard or mutable spinlocks]({{% relref
  "pipeline/usage/locking.md#new-spinlocks" %}}).

## Check that the pipeline torture tests pass

Before any consideration is made to implement out-of-band code on a
platform, check that interrupt pipelining is sane there, by enabling
`CONFIG_IRQ_PIPELINE_TORTURE_TEST` in the configuration. As its name
suggests, this option enables test code which excercizes the
[interrupt pipeline core]({{% relref "pipeline/porting/irqflow.md" %}}), and
related features such as the [proxy tick device]({{%
relref "pipeline/porting/timer.md" %}}).

## Know how to differentiate safe from unsafe in-band code

Not all in-band kernel code is safe to be called from out-of-band
context, actually most of it is **unsafe** for doing so.

A code is deemed safe in this respect when you are 101% sure that it
never does, directly or indirectly, any of the following:

- attempts to reschedule in-band wise, meaning that `schedule()` would
  end up being called. The rule of thumb is that any section of code
  traversing the regular `might_sleep()` check cannot be called from
  out-of-band context.

- takes a spinlock from any regular type like raw_spinlock_t or
  spinlock_t. The former would affect the virtual interrupt disable
  flag which is invalid outside of the in-band context, the latter
  might reschedule if `CONFIG_PREEMPT` is enabled.

{{% notice tip %}}
In the early days of dual kernel support in Linux, some people would
mistakenly invoke the `do_gettimeofday()` routine from an out-of-band
context in order to get a wallclock timestamp for their real-time
code. Doing so would create a deadlock situation if some in-band code
running `do_gettimeofday()` is preempted by the out-of-band code
re-entering the same routine on the same CPU.  The out-of-band code
would then wait spinning indefinitely for the in-band context to leave the
routine - which won't happen by design - leading to a lockup.  Nowadays,
enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ_PIPELINE would be enough to detect such mistake
early enough to preserve your mental health.

## Careful with disabling interrupts in the CPU

When pipelining is enabled, use [hard interrupt protection]({{% relref
"pipeline/usage/interrupt_protection.md#hard-irq-protection" %}}) with
caution, especially from in-band code. Not only this might send
latency figures over the top, but this might even cause random lockups
would a rescheduling happen while interrupts are hard disabled.

## Dealing with spinlocks {#spinlock-rule}

Converting regular kernel spinlocks (e.g. `spinlock_t`,
`raw_spin_lock_t`) to hard spinlocks should involve a careful review
of every section covered by such lock. Any such section would then
inherit the following requirements:

- no unsafe in-band kernel service should be called within the
  section.

- the section covered by the lock should be short enough to keep
  interrupt latency low.

## Enable RAW_PRINTK support for printk-like debugging

Unless you are lucky enough to have an ICE for debugging hard issues
involving out-of-band contexts, you might have to resort to basic
printk-style debugging. If so, do **NOT** rely on the regular
_printk()_ routine for this, this won't work in most cases.  See how
to provide for a printk-like [raw debug channel]({{% relref
"pipeline/porting/rawprintk.md" %}}) over a serial console instead.
