# The Evenless project

_Evenless_ (EVL for short) is a software project for implementing a
compact real-time core into the Linux kernel, which delivers reliable
real-time performances at low engineering, maintenance and runtime
costs.

This project builds on the experience garnered during nearly two
decades developing [Xenomai's](https://xenomai.org/) dual kernel
technology.
