## Adapting the generic interrupt management (genirq) {#genirq-flow}

Interrupt pipelining involves a basic change in controlling the
interrupt flow: `handle_domain_irq()` from the IRQ domain API
redirects all parent IRQs to the pipeline entry by calling
`generic_pipeline_irq()`, instead of `generic_handle_irq()`.

Generic flow handlers acknowledge the incoming IRQ event in the
hardware as usual, by calling the appropriate `irqchip` routine
(e.g. `irq_ack()`, `irq_eoi()`) according to the interrupt
type. However, the flow handlers do not immediately invoke the in-band
interrupt handlers. Instead, they hand the event over to the pipeline
core by calling `handle_oob_irq()`.

If an out-of-band handler exists for the interrupt received,
`handle_oob_irq()` invokes it immediately, after switching the
execution context to the oob stage if not current yet. Otherwise, the
event is marked as pending in the in-band stage's log for the current
CPU.

The execution flow throughout the kernel code in Dovetail's pipelined
interrupt model is illustrated by the following figure. Note the
two-step process: first we try delivering the incoming IRQ to any
out-of-band handler if present, then we may play any IRQ pending in
the current per-CPU log, among which non-OOB events may reside.

![Alt text](/images/irqflow.png "Pipelined interrupt handling")

As illustrated above, interrupt flow handlers may run twice for a
single IRQ in Dovetail's pipelined interrupt model:

- first to submit the event immediately to any out-of-band handler
which may be interested in it. This is achieved by calling
`handle_oob_irq()`, whose role is to invoke such handler(s) if
present, or schedule an in-band handling of the IRQ event if not.

- finally to run the in-band handler(s) accepting the IRQ event if it
was not delivered to any out-of-band handler. To deliver the event to
any in-band handler(s), the interrupt flow handler is called again by
the pipeline core. When this happens, the flow handler processes the
interrupt as usual, skipping the call to `handle_oob_irq()` though.

{{% notice note %}}
Any incoming IRQ event is either dispatched to one or more out-of-band
handlers, or one or more in-band handlers, but never to a mix of
them. Also, because _every_ interrupt which is _not_ handled by an
out-of-band handler will end up into the in-band stage's event log
unconditionally, all external interrupts must have a handler in the
in-band code - which should be the case for a sane kernel anyway.
{{% /notice %}}

Once `generic_pipeline_irq()` has returned, if the preempted execution
context was running over the in-band stage unstalled, the pipeline
core synchronizes the interrupt state immediately, meaning that all
IRQs found pending in the in-band stage's log are immediately
delivered to their respective in-band handlers. In all other
situations, the IRQ frame is left immediately without running those
handlers. The IRQs may remain pending until the in-band code resumes
from preemption, then clears the [virtual interrupt disable
flag]({{%relref "dovetail/pipeline/_index.md#virtual-i-flag" %}}),
which would cause the interrupt state to be synchronized, running the
in-band handlers eventually.

### In-band IRQ delivery glue code {#arch-do-irq}

For delivering pending interrupts to the in-band stage, the generic
Dovetail core synchronizing the IRQ stage calls a routine named
`arch_do_IRQ_pipelined()`, which _you must provide as part of the
pipeline's arch-specific support code_. This function is passed both
device IRQs and IPIs, it should dispatch the event accordingly
according to the following logic:

{{<mermaid align="left">}}
graph LR;
      S(IRQ stage sync) --> E["arch_do_IRQ_pipelined()"]
      style E fill:#99ccff;
      E --> A{Is IPI?}

      style B fill:#99ccff;
      A -->|No| C["do_domain_irq()"]
      style C fill:#99ccff;
{{< /mermaid >}}

For ARM and ARM64, the corresponding code looks like this:

```
void arch_do_IRQ_pipelined(struct irq_desc *desc)
{
	struct pt_regs *regs = raw_cpu_ptr(&irq_pipeline.tick_regs);
	unsigned int irq = irq_desc_get_irq(desc);

#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	/*
	 * Check for IPIs, handing them over to the specific dispatch
	 * code.
	 */
	if (irq >= OOB_IPI_BASE &&
	    irq < OOB_IPI_BASE + NR_IPI + OOB_NR_IPI) {
		__handle_IPI(irq - OOB_IPI_BASE, regs);
		return;
	}
#endif

	do_domain_irq(irq, regs);
}
```

A couple of notes reading this code:

- `do_domain_irq()` is a routine the generic Dovetail core implements,
  which fires the in-band handler for a device IRQ.

- How IPIs differentiate from other IRQs, which handler should be
  called for them is an [arch-specific implementation]({{< relref
  "dovetail/pipeline/porting/arch.md#dealing-with-ipis" >}}) you
  should provide in porting Dovetail. In the code example above, the
  IPI handling routine is named `__handle_IPI()`.

- Since the interrupt delivery is deferred for the in-band stage until
  the latter is synchronized eventually, we don't have access to the
  preempted register frame for a delayed interrupt event. Said
  differently, the interrupt context has already returned, only
  logging the interrupt event but not dispatching it yet, and the
  stack-based register frame of the preempted context is long
  gone. Fortunately, the kernel is normally only interested in
  analyzing frames attached to timer events (e.g. for profiling), so
  Dovetail only needs to save the register frame corresponding to the
  last tick event received to the per-CPU `irq_pipeline.tick_regs`
  variable. A pointer to such frame for the current CPU can be passed
  by your implementation of `arch_do_IRQ_pipelined()` to the interrupt
  handler.

### Deferring level-triggered IRQs

In absence of any out-of-band handler for the event, the device may
keep asserting the interrupt signal until the cause has been lifted in
its own registers. At the same time, we might not be allowed to run
the in-band handler immediately over the current interrupt context if
the in-band stage is currently stalled, we would have to wait for the
in-band code to accept interrupts again. However, the interrupt
disable bit in the CPU would certainly be cleared in the meantime. For
this reason, depending on the interrupt type, the flow handlers as
modified by the pipeline code may have to mask the interrupt line
until the in-band handler has run from the in-band stage, lifting the
interrupt cause. This typically happens with level-triggered
interrupts, preventing the device from storming the CPU with a
continuous interrupt request.

> The pathological case
```markdown
    /* no OOB handler, in-band stage stalled on entry
       leading to deferred dispatch to handler */
    asm_irq_entry
       ...
          -> generic_pipeline_irq()
             ...
                <IRQ logged, delivery deferred>
    asm_irq_exit
    /*
     * CPU allowed to accept interrupts again with IRQ cause not
     * acknowledged in device yet => **IRQ storm**.
     */
    asm_irq_entry
       ...
    asm_irq_exit
    asm_irq_entry
       ...
    asm_irq_exit
```

Since all of the IRQ handlers sharing an interrupt line are either
in-band or out-of-band in a mutually exclusive way, such masking
cannot delay out-of-band events.

{{% notice tip %}}
The logic behind masking interrupt lines until events are processed at
some point later - out of the original interrupt context - applies
exactly the same to the threaded interrupt model
(i.e. `IRQF_THREAD`). In this case, interrupt lines may be masked
until the IRQ thread is scheduled in, after the interrupt handler
clears the event cause eventually.
{{% /notice %}}

### Adapting the interrupt flow handlers to pipelining

The logic for adapting flow handlers dealing with interrupt pipelining
is composed of the following steps:

+ (optionally) enter the critical section protected by the IRQ
  descriptor lock, if the interrupt is shared among processors
  (e.g. device interrupts). If so, check if the interrupt handler may
  run on the current CPU (`irq_may_run()`). By definition, no locking
  would be required for per-CPU interrupts.

+ check whether we are entering the pipeline in order to deliver the
  interrupt to any out-of-band handler registered for
  it. `on_pipeline_entry()` returns a boolean value denoting this
  situation.

+ if on pipeline entry, we should pass the event on to the pipeline
  core by calling `handle_oob_irq()`. Upon return, this routine tells
  the caller whether any out-of-band handler was fired for the
  event.

  - if so, we may assume that the interrupt cause is now cleared in
    the device, and we may leave the flow handler, after having
    restored the interrupt line into a normal state. In case of a
    level-triggered interrupt which has been masked on entry to the
    flow handler, we need to unmask the line before leaving.

  - if no out-of-band handler was called, we should have performed any
    acknowledge and/or EOI to release the interrupt line in the
    controller, while leaving it masked if required before exiting the
    flow handler. In case of a level-triggered interrupt, we do want
    to leave it masked for solving the pathological case with
    interrupt deferral explained earlier.

+ if not on pipeline entry (i.e. second entry of the flow handler),
  then we must be running over the in-band stage, accepting interrupts,
  therefore we should fire the in-band handler(s) for the incoming
  event.

+		if (handle_oob_irq(desc))
+			goto out_unmask;
+		goto out_unlock;
+	}

```

This change reads as follows:

- on entering the pipeline, which means immediately over the interrupt
  frame context set up by the CPU for receiving the event, tell the
  pipeline core about the incoming IRQ.

- if this IRQ was handled by an out-of-band handler
  (`handle_oob_irq()` returns _true_), consider the event to have been
  fully processed, unmasking the interrupt line before leaving. We
  can't do more than this, simply because the in-band kernel code
  might expect not to receive any interrupt at this point (i.e. the
  [virtual interrupt disable flag]({{%relref
  "dovetail/pipeline/_index.md#virtual-i-flag" %}}) might be set
  for the in-band stage).

- otherwise, keep the interrupt line masked until `handle_level_irq()`
  is called again from a safe context for handling in-band interrupts,
  at which point the event should be delivered to the in-band
  interrupt handler of the main kernel. We have to keep the line
  masked to prevent the IRQ storm which would certainly happen
  otherwise, since no handler has cleared the cause of the interrupt
  event in the device yet.

## Fixing up the IRQ chip drivers {#irqchip-fixup}

We must make sure that the following handlers exported by `irqchip`
drivers can operate over the out-of-band context safely:

- `irq_mask()`
- `irq_ack()`
- `irq_mask_ack()`
- `irq_eoi()`
- `irq_unmask()`

For so-called _device interrupts_, no change is required, because the
_genirq_ layer ensures that a single CPU at most handles a given IRQ
event by holding the per-descriptor `irq_desc::lock` spinlock across
calls to those `irqchip` handlers, and such lock is automatically
turned into a [mutable spinlock]({{%relref
"dovetail/pipeline/usage/locking.md#new-spinlocks" %}}) when
pipelining interrupts. In other words, those handlers are properly
serialized, running with interrupts disabled in the CPU as their
non-pipelined implementation expects it.

Unlike for device interrupts, per-CPU interrupt handling does not need
to be serialized this way, since by definition, there cannot be
multiple CPUs racing for access with such type of events.

However, there might other reasons to fix up some of those handlers:

- they must not invoke **any** in-band kernel service, which might
cause an [invalid context re-entry]({{%relref
"dovetail/pipeline/_index.md#no-inband-reentry" %}}).

- there may be inner spinlocks locally defined by some `irqchip`
drivers for serializing access to a common interrupt controller
hardware for _distinct_ IRQs being handled by multiple CPUs
concurrently. Adapting such spinlocked sections found in `irqchip`
drivers to support interrupt pipelining may involve [converting the
related spinlocks]({{%relref "dovetail/rulesofthumb.md#spinlock-rule"
%}}) to hard spinlocks.

Other section of code which were originally serialized by common
interrupt disabling may need to be made fully atomic for running
consistenly in pipelined interrupt mode. This can be done by
introducing hard masking, converting `local_irq_save()` calls to
`hard_local_irq_save()`, conversely `local_irq_restore()` to
`hard_local_irq_restore()`.

Finally, `IRQCHIP_PIPELINE_SAFE` must be added to the `struct
irqchip::flags` member of a pipeline-aware `irqchip` driver, in order
to notify the kernel that such controller can operate in pipelined
interrupt mode. Even if you did not introduce any other change to
support pipelining, this one is required: it tells the kernel that you
did review the code for that purpose.

In some (rare) cases, we might have a bit more work for adapting an
interrupt chip driver. For instance, we might have to convert a
sleeping spinlock to a raw spinlock first, so that we can convert the
latter to a hard spinlock eventually. Hard spinlocks like raw ones
should be manipulated via the `raw_spin_lock()` API, unlike sleeping
spinlocks.

target system is incomplete.

## Kernel preemption control (CONFIG_PREEMPT)

When pipelining is enabled, Dovetail ensures that
`preempt_schedule_irq()` reconciles the virtual interrupt state -
which has not been touched by the assembly level code upon kernel
entry - with basic assumptions made by the scheduler core, such as
entering with interrupts virtually disabled (i.e. the in-band stage
should be stalled).

## Extended IRQ work API {#irq-work}

Due to the NMI-type nature of interrupts running out-of-band code from
the standpoint of the main kernel, such code might preempt in-band
activities in the middle of a [critical section]({{%relref
"dovetail/pipeline/_index.md#no-inband-reentry" %}}). For this
reason, it would be unsafe to call any in-band routine from an
out-of-band context.

However, we may schedule execution of in-band work handlers from
out-of-band code, using the regular `irq_work_queue()` service which
has been extended by the IRQ pipeline core. Such work request from the
oob stage is scheduled for running on the in-band stage on the issuing
CPU as soon as the out-of-band activity quiesces on this processor. As
its name implies, the work handler runs in (in-band) interrupt
context.

{{% notice note %}}
The interrupt pipeline forces the use of a [synthetic IRQ]({{% relref
"dovetail/pipeline/usage/synthetic.md" %}}) as a notification signal
for the IRQ work machinery, instead of a hardware-specific interrupt
vector. This special IRQ is labeled _in-band work_ when reported by
`/proc/interrupts`.
