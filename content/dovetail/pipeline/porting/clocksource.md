Your autonomous core is most likely to need a fast access to the
current clock source from out-of-band context, for reading precise
timestamps. The best way to achieve this is by enabling the fast
`clock_gettime()` helper in the [vDSO
support](https://lwn.net/Articles/615809/) for the target CPU
architecture. At least, you will want user-space tasks controlled by
the core to have access to the POSIX-defined `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and
`CLOCK_REALTIME` clocks from the out-of-band context, with no
execution time penalty due to invoking an [in-band syscall] ({{<
relref "dovetail/altsched/_index.md#inband-switch" >}}).

In most cases, the support for reading the current time base used by
the kernel from the vDSO is already available, and may be called from
any task context, including from tasks [running out-of-band]({{<
relref "dovetail/altsched/_index.md#altsched-theory" >}}) without
incurring any [execution stage switch]({{< relref
"dovetail/altsched/_index.md#stage-migration" >}}).
