## Proxy tick device

The proxy tick device is a synthetic clock event device for handing
over the control of the hardware tick device to a high-precision,
out-of-band timing logic, [which cannot be delayed]({{%relref
"/_index.md#dual-kernel-upsides" %}}) by the in-band kernel code.
With this proxy in place, any out-of-band code can gain control over
the timer hardware for carrying out its own timing duties. In the same
move, it is required to honor the timing requests received from the
in-band timer layer (i.e. hrtimers) since the latter won't be able to
program timer events directly into the hardware while the proxy is
active.

In other words, the proxy tick device shares the functionality of the
actual device between the in-band and out-of-band contexts, with only
the latter actually programming the hardware.

### Adapting clock chip devices for proxying

The proxy tick device borrows a real clock chip device from the
in-band kernel, controlling it under the hood while substituting for
the current tick device. Clock chips which may be controlled by the
proxy tick device need their drivers to be specifically adapted for
such use, as follows:

+ `clockevents_handle_event()` must be substituted to any open-coded
invocation of the event handler in the interrupt handler.

+ `struct clock_event_device::irq` must be properly set to the actual
IRQ number signaling an event from this device.

+ `struct clock_event_device::features` must include
`CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_PIPELINE`.

+ `__IRQF_TIMER` must be set for the action handler of the timer
device interrupt.

This is another example of adapting an existing clock chip driver for
serving out-of-band timing requests, with a subtle change in the way
we should test for the current state of the clock device in the
interrupt handler:

- A real/original device (such as the ARM global timer in this
  example) is switched to _detached_ mode when the proxy tick driver
  hands it over to the autonomous core. Therefore, the ARM global
  timer state is always _detached_ from the standpoint of the kernel
  when proxied, never _oneshot_. For this reason,
  `clockevent_state_oneshot()` would always lead to _false_ in this
  case.

- However, since a real device controlled by the proxy for receiving
  out-of-band events has to be driven in one-shot mode under the hood,
  testing for `clockevent_state_oob()` in addition to
  `clockevent_state_oneshot()` guarantees that we do take the branch,
  setting the comparator register to ULONG_MAX when proxied too.

{{% notice warning %}}
Failing to fix up the way we test for the clock device state would
certainly lead to an interrupt storm with any ARM global timer
suffering erratum 740657, quickly locking up the board.

### Theory of operations {#proxy-tick-logic}

Calling `tick_install_proxy()` creates an instance of the proxy tick
device on each CPU mentioned in the `cpumask` it receives.  This
routine is also passed a pointer to a `struct proxy_tick_ops`
operation descriptor (`ops`), defining a few handlers the caller
should provide for installing and managing the proxy device.

> The proxy operation descriptor

```
struct proxy_tick_ops {
	void (*register_device)(struct clock_event_device *proxy_ced,
				struct clock_event_device *real_ced);
	void (*unregister_device)(struct clock_event_device *proxy_ced,
				  struct clock_event_device *real_ced);
	void (*handle_event)(struct clock_event_device *real_ced);
};
```

`tick_install_proxy()` first invokes `ops->register_device()` for
doing the prep work for the synthetic device, allowing the client code
to chose its settings before registering it, typically by a call to
`clockevents_config_and_register()`. This device registration handler
should fill the clock event device structure pointed by `proxy_ced`,
defining the proxy device characteristics from the standpoint of the
in-band kernel, just like a clock chip driver would do. `real_ced` is
the actual clock event device being substituted for.

Conversely, `ops->unregister_device()` is an optional handler called
by `tick_uninstall_proxy()` for dismantling a proxy device. NULL may
be given if the autonomous core has no specific action to take upon
such event. In any case, `tick_uninstall_proxy()` ensures that the
proxy is fully detached and all the related resources are freed before
returning.

{{% notice note %}}
Although this is not strictly required, it is highly expected that
`register_device()` gives a better rating to the proxy device than the
original tick device's, so that the in-band kernel would substitute the
former for the latter.

> A `register_device()` handler preparing a proxy device

```
static void proxy_device_register(struct clock_event_device *proxy_ced,
				  struct clock_event_device *real_ced)
{
	/*
	 * We know how to deal with delays expressed as counts of
	 * nanosecs directly for programming events (i.e. no need
	 * to translate into cycles).
	 */
	proxy_ced->features |= CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_KTIME;
	/*
	 * The handler which would receive in-band timing
	 * requests.
	 */
	proxy_ced->set_next_ktime = proxy_set_next_ktime;
	proxy_ced->set_next_event = NULL;
	/*
	 * Make sure we substitute for the real device:
	 * advertise a better rating.
	 */
	proxy_ced->rating = real_ced->rating + 1;
	proxy_ced->min_delta_ns = 1;
	proxy_ced->max_delta_ns = KTIME_MAX;
	proxy_ced->min_delta_ticks = 1;
	proxy_ced->max_delta_ticks = ULONG_MAX;

	/* All set, register now. */
	clockevents_register_device(proxy_ced);
}
```

{{% notice tip %}}
As illustrated above, the `set_next_event()` or `set_next_ktime()`
member should be set in the structure pointed by `proxy_ced` with the
address of a handler which receives timer requests from the in-band
kernel. This handler is normally implemented by the autonomous core which
takes control over the timer hardware via the proxy device. Whenever
that core determines that a tick is due for an outstanding request
received from such handler, it should call `tick_notify_proxy()` to
signal the event to the main kernel.
We add `CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_KTIME` to the proxy device flags because the
autonomous core managing this device uses nanoseconds internally for
expressing delays. For this reason, we want the main kernel to send
timer requests to this core by passing delays as a count of
nanoseconds to `set_next_ktime()` directly, without any conversion to
hardware clock ticks.

Once the user-supplied `ops->register_device()` handler returns, the
following events happen in sequence:

1. with a rating most likely set to be higher than the current tick
   device's (i.e. the _real_ device), the proxy device substitutes for
   the former.

2. the real device is detached from the `clockevent` layer. However, it
   is left in a functional state. The `set_next_event()` handler of
   this device is redirected to the user-supplied
   `ops->handle_event()` handler. This way, every tick received from
   the real device would be passed on to the latter.

3. the proxy device starts controlling the real device under the hood
   to carry out timing requests from the in-band kernel. When the
   `hrtimer` layer from the in-band kernel wants to program the next
   shot of the current tick device, it invokes the `set_next_event()`
   handler of the proxy device, which was defined by the caller. This
   handler should be scheduling in-band ticks at the requested time
   based on its own timer management.

4. the timer interrupt triggered by the real device is switched to
   out-of-band handling. As a result, `ops->handle_event()` receives
   tick events sent by the real device hardware directly from the oob
   stage of the interrupt pipeline, over the out-of-band context. This
   ensures high-precision timing. From that point, the out-of-band
   code can carry out its own timing duties, in addition to honoring
   the in-band kernel requests for timing.

Step 3. involves emulating ticks scheduled by the in-band kernel by a
software logic controlled by some out-of-band timer management, paced
by the real ticks received as described in step 4. When this logic
decides than the next in-band tick is due, it should call
`tick_notify_proxy()` to trigger the corresponding event for the
in-band kernel, which would honor the pending (hr)timer request.
