# Things you definitely want to know

## Generic issues

### **isolcpus** is our friend too {#caveat-isocpus}

Isolating some CPUs on the kernel command line using the _isolcpus=_
option, in order to prevent the load balancer from offloading in-band
work to them is not only a good idea with
[PREEMPT_RT](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/rtl/blog), but
for any dual kernel configuration too.

By doing so, having some random in-band work evicting cache lines on a
CPU where real-time threads briefly sleep is less likely, increasing
the odds of costly cache misses, which translates positively into the
latency numbers you can get. Even if EVL's small footprint core has a
limited exposure to such kind of disturbance, saving a handful of
microseconds is worth it when the worst case figure is already within
tenths of microseconds.

### **CONFIG_DEBUG_HARD_LOCKS** is cool but ruins real-time guarantees

When CONFIG_DEBUG_HARD_LOCKS is enabled, the lock dependency engine
(CONFIG_LOCKDEP) which helps in tracking down deadlocks and other
locking-related issues is also enabled for Dovetail's [hard
locks]({{% relref "dovetail/pipeline/locking.md#new-spinlocks" %}}),
which underpins most of the serialization mechanisms the EVL core
uses.

This is nice as it has the lock validator monitor the hard spinlocks
EVL uses too. However, this comes with a high price latency-wise:
seeing hundreds of microseconds spent in the validator with hard
interrupts off from time to time is not uncommon. Running the latency
monitoring utility (aka `latmus`) which is part of `libevl` in this
configuration should give you pretty ugly numbers.

In short, it is fine enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_HARD_LOCKS for debugging
some locking pattern in EVL, but you won't be able to meet real-time
requirements at the same time in such configuration.

### CPU frequency scaling (usually) has a negative impact on latency {#caveat-cpufreq}

Enabling the _ondemand_ CPUFreq governor - or any governor performing
dynamic adjustment of the CPU frequency - may induce significant
latency for EVL on your system, from ten microseconds to more than a
hundred depending on the hardware. Selecting the so-called
_performance_ governor is the safe option, which guarantees that no
frequency transition ever happens, keeping the CPUs at their maximum
processing speed.

In other words, if CONFIG_CPU_FREQ has to be enabled in your
configuration, enabling CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE and
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE exclusively is most often the best way
to prevent unexpectedly high latency peaks.

### Disable CONFIG_SMP for best latency on single-core systems

On single-core hardware, some out-of-line code may still be executed
for dealing with various types of spinlock with a SMP build, which
translates into additional CPU branches and cache misses. On low end
hardware, this overhead may be noticeable.

Therefore, if you neither need SMP support nor kernel debug options
which depend on instrumenting the spinlock constructs (e.g.
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT), you may want to disable all the related kernel
options, starting with CONFIG_SMP.

## Architecture-specific issues

### x86

- CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR_IDLE may increase the latency upon wakeup on
  IRQ from idle on some SoC (up to 30 us observed) on x86. This option
  is implicitly selected by the following configuration chain:
  CONFIG_SCHED_MC_PRIO &#8594; CONFIG_INTEL_PSTATE &#8594;
  CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR. If out-of-range latency figures are observed
  on your x86 hardware, turning off this chain may help.

- NMI-based _perf_ data collection may cause the kernel to execute
  utterly sluggish ACPI driver code at each event. Since disabling
  CONFIG_PERF is not an option, passing **nmi_watchodg=0** on the
  kernel command line at boot may help.
