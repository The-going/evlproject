Building EVL is a two-step process, which may happen in any order:

- a Linux kernel image featuring the EVL core is built.

- the EVL library (aka _libevl_), basic utilities and test programs
  are generated.

## Prerequisites

We need:

- a GCC toolchain for the target CPU architecture.

- the UAPI headers from the target Linux kernel fit with the EVL
  core. In other words, we need access to the contents of
  `include/uapi/asm/` and `include/uapi/evl/` from a source kernel
  tree which contains the EVL core code.

{{% notice warning %}}
libevl relies on thread-local storage support (TLS), which might be
broken in some obsolete toolchains.

## Building the core {#building-evl-core}

The kernel source tree which includes the latest EVL core is
maintained at git://git.evenless.org/linux-evl. The development branch
is _evl/master_.

Once your favorite kernel configuration tool is brought up, you should
see the EVL configuration block somewhere inside the **General setup**
menu. This configuration block looks like this:

![Alt text](/images/core_xconfig.png?classes=border,shadow "EVL core configuration")

Enabling `CONFIG_EVL` should be enough to get you started, the default
values for other EVL settings are safe to use. You should make sure to
have `CONFIG_EVL_LATMUS` and `CONFIG_EVL_HECTIC` enabled too; those
are drivers required for running the `latmus` and `hectic` utilities
available with `libevl`, which measure latency and validate the
context switching sanity.

## Building libevl {#building-libevl}

### Build command

The generic command for building libevl is:

```
$ make [-C $SRCDIR] [ARCH=$cpu_arch] [CROSS_COMPILE=$toolchain] UAPI=$uapi_dir [OTHER_BUILD_VARS] [goal...]
```

> Main build variables

| Variable   |  Description
| --------   |    -------
| $SRCDIR    |  Path to this source tree
| $cpu_arch  |   CPU architecture you build for ('arm', 'arm64')
| $toolchain |  Optional prefix of the binutils filename (e.g. 'aarch64-linux-gnu-', 'arm-linux-gnueabihf-')

> Other build variables

| Variable      |  Description   |  Default
| --------      |    -------     |  -------
| D={0\|1}      |  Disable or enable debug build, i.e. -g -O0 vs -O2    | 0
| O=$output_dir |  Generate binary output files into $output_dir        | .
| V={0\|1}      |  Set build verbosity level, 0 is terse                | 0
| DESTDIR=$install_dir | Install library and binaries into $install_dir | /usr/evl

> Make goals

| Goal    |     Action
| ---     |     ---
| all     |     generate all binaries (library, utilities and tests)
| clean   |     remove the build files
| install |     do all, copying the generated binaries to $DESTDIR in the process

### Examples

Let's say the library source code is located at ~/git/libevl, and the
kernel sources featuring the EVL core is located at
~/git/linux-evl. Building and installing the EVL library and utilities
directly to a staging directory at /nfsroot/\<machine\>/usr/evl would
amount to:

> Building from a (temporary) build directory

```
$ mkdir /tmp/build-imx6q && cd /tmp/build-imx6q
$ make -C ~/git/libevl O=$PWD ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- UAPI=~/git/linux-evl DESTDIR=/nfsroot/imx6q/usr/evl install
```

or,

> Building directly into the EVL library source tree

```
$ mkdir /tmp/build-hikey
$ cd ~/git/libevl
$ make O=/tmp/build-hikey ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- UAPI=~/git/linux-evl DESTDIR=/nfsroot/hikey/usr/evl install
```
