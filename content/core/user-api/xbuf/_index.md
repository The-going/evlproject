### Bi-directional out-of-band &#8660; in-band messaging

A most typical requirement in dual kernel systems is to exchange data
between threads running in separate execution stages, i.e. out-of-band
vs in-band, without incuring any delay for the out-of-band side.  The
EVL core implements a feature called a _cross-buffer_ (aka _xbuf_),
which connects the sending out-of-band end of a communication channel
to its receiving in-band end, and conversely. As a result, data sent
to a cross-buffer by calling [oob_write()]({{< relref
"core/user-api/io/_index.md#oob_write" >}}) are received by calling
[read(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html), data sent
by calling
[write(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html) are
received by calling [oob_read()]({{< relref
"core/user-api/io/_index.md#oob_read" >}}). A cross-buffer can be used
for transferring fixed-size or variable-size data, supports
message-based and byte-oriented streams. For instance, such a
mechanism would enable a GUI front-end to receive monitoring data from
a real-time work loop.

#### xbuf-specific semantics for sending and receiving

The following rules apply to cross-buffer transfers, in either
directions (inbound and outbound):

- If O_NONBLOCK is clear on the cross-buffer file descriptor, there
  are no short reads on the receiving end: a reader always gets a
  complete message of the requested length, blocking if necessary
  _except_ if a sender is currently blocked on the other end of the
  channel, waiting for some space to be available into the ring buffer
  to complete a write operation. In this case, a short read is
  performed to prevent a deadlock, which means the reader may receive
  less data than requested in the read call. This situation arises
  when the size picked for the ring buffer does not fit the transfer
  pattern, such as follows:

![Alt text](/images/xbuf-deadlock.png "Cross-buffer deadlock prevention")

{{% notice tip %}}
If you plan to send fixed-size messages through a cross-buffer and
keeping the message boundaries intact matters, you should pick a
buffer size which is a multiple of the basic message size, reading
and writing complete messages at each transfer.
{{% /notice %}}

  Otherwise, if O_NONBLOCK is set and not enough bytes are immediately
  available from the ring buffer for satisfying the request, the write
  operation fails with the `EAGAIN` error status.

- There are no short or scattered writes to the ring buffer: the
  operation either succeeds immediately or blocks until enough space
  is available into the buffer for copying the entire message
  atomically, unless O_NONBLOCK is set on the cross-buffer file
  descriptor (`EAGAIN`).

### Cross-buffer services {#xbuf-services}

{{< proto evl_new_xbuf >}}
int evl_new_xbuf(size_t i_bufsz, size_t o_bufsz,  const char *fmt, ...)
{{< /proto >}}

This call creates a new cross-buffer, then returns a file descriptor
representing the communication channel upon success. Internally, a
cross-buffer is implemented as a pair of ring buffers conveying data
from in-band to out-of-band context (i.e. _inbound_ traffic), and
conversely (i.e. _outbound_ traffic).

{{% argument i_bufsz %}}
The size in bytes of the ring buffer conveying inbound traffic. If
zero, the cross-buffer is intended to relay outbound messages
exclusively, i.e. from the in-band to the out-of-band context.
{{% /argument %}}

{{% argument o_bufsz %}}
The size in bytes of the ring buffer conveying outbound traffic. If
zero, the cross-buffer is intended to relay inbound messages
exclusively, i.e. from the out-of-band to the in-band context.
{{% /argument %}}

{{% argument fmt %}}
A [printf(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html)-like
format string to generate the cross-buffer name. A common way of generating
unique names is to add the calling process's _pid_ somewhere into the
format string as illustrated in the example. The generated name is
used to form a last part of a pathname, referring to the new
[cross-buffer]({{< relref "core/_index.md" >}}) device in the file system. So
this name must contain only valid characters in this context,
excluding slashes.
{{% /argument %}}

{{% argument "..." %}}
The optional variable argument list completing the format.
{{% /argument %}}

`evl_new_xbuf()` returns the file descriptor of the new cross-buffer on
success. If the call fails, a negated error code is returned instead:

- -EEXIST	The generated name is conflicting with an existing cross-buffer.

- -EINVAL	Either _i_bufsz_ and/or _o_bufsz_ are wrong, or the
  		generated cross-buffer name is badly formed, likely containing
		invalid character(s), such as a slash. Keep in mind that
		it should be usable as a basename of a device file path.
		Any buffer size must not exceed 2^30.

- -ENAMETOOLONG	The overall length of the device element's file path including
		the generated name exceeds PATH_MAX.

- -EMFILE	The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors
		has been reached.

- -ENFILE	The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
		has been reached.

- -ENOMEM	No memory available.

- -ENXIO	The EVL library is not initialized for the current process.
  		Such initialization happens implicitly when
  		[evl_attach_self()]({{% relref
  		"core/user-api/thread/_index.md#evl_attach_self" %}})
  		is called by any thread of your process, or by
  		explicitly calling [evl_init()]({{< relref
  		"core/user-api/init/_index.md#evl_init" >}}). You have
  		to bootstrap the library services in a way or another
  		before creating a cross-buffer.

### Events pollable from a cross-buffer descriptor {#xbuf-poll-events}

The [evl_poll()]({{< relref "core/user-api/poll/_index.md" >}})
interface can monitor the following events occurring on a cross-buffer
file descriptor:

- _POLLIN_ and _POLLRDNORM_ are set whenever data coming from the
  in-band side is available for reading by a call to [oob_read()]({{<
  relref "core/user-api/io/_index.md#oob_read" >}}).

- _POLLOUT_ and _POLLWRNORM_ are set whenever there is still room in
  the output ring buffer for sending more data to the in-band side
  using [oob_write()]({{< relref
  "core/user-api/io/_index.md#oob_write" >}}).

Conversely, you can also use the in-band
[poll(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html) on a
cross-buffer file descriptor, monitoring the following events:

- _POLLIN_ and _POLLRDNORM_ are set whenever data coming from the
  out-of-band side is available for reading, by a call to
  [read(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html).
  
- _POLLOUT_ and _POLLWRNORM_ are set whenever there is still room in
  the output ring buffer for sending more data to the out-of-band
  side, using
  [write(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html).
