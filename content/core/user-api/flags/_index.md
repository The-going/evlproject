### Synchronizing on a group of flags {#synchronizing-on-flags}

An event flag group is an efficient and lightweight mechanism for
synchronizing multiple threads, based on a 32bit value, in which each
individual bit represents the state of a particular event defined by
the application. Therefore, each group defines 32 individual events,
from bit #0 to bit #31. Threads can wait for bits to be posted by
other threads. Although EVL's event flag group API is somewhat
reminiscent of the [eventfd
interface](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html), it is
much simpler:

- on the send side, posting the _bits_ event mask to an event _group_
  is equivalent to performing atomically a bitwise OR operation such
  as _group |= bits_.
 
- on the receive side, waiting for events means blocking until _group_
  becomes non-zero, at which point this value is returned to the
  thread heading the wait queue and the group is reset to zero in the
  same move. In other words, all bits set are immediately consumed by
  the first waiter and cleared in the group atomically. Threads wait
  on a group by priority order, which is determined by the [scheduling
  policy]({{< relref "core/user-api/scheduling/_index.md" >}}) they
  undergo.

{{% notice tip %}}
Unlike with the
[eventfd](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html), there
is no semaphore semantics associated to an event flag group, you may
want to consider the EVL [semaphore]({{< relref
"core/user-api/semaphore/_index.md" >}}) feature instead if this is
what you are looking for.
