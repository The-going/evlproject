This (work-in-progress) section will help you navigate the design and
implementation of the [EVL core]({{< relref "core/_index.md" >}}). It
is written from a developer perspective as a practical example of
implementing a companion core living in the Linux kernel, emphasizing
on details about the way the [Dovetail interface]({{< relref
"dovetail/_index.md" >}}) is leveraged for this purpose. This
information is intended to help anyone interested in or simply curious
about the "other path to Linux real-time", whether it is useful for
developing your own Linux-based dual kernel system, contributing to
EVL, or educational purpose.
