Since we have service calls between the applications and the EVL core,
we depend on a certain format of request codes, arguments and return
values when exchanging information between both ends, like the
contents of the argument structure passed to the various
[ioctl(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html) and
[oob_ioctl()]({{< relref "core/user-api/io/_index.md#oob_ioctl" >}})
requests. This convention forms the EVL ABI. As hard as we might try
to keep the ABI stable over time, there are times when this cannot be
achieved, at the very least because we may want to make new features
added to the EVL core visible to applications. Generally speaking, EVL
being a new kid in the old dual kernel town, it is too early - for the
time being - to write the current convention in stone. This fact of
life calls for a way to unambiguously:

- determine which (range of subsequent) revision(s) of the ABI is
  _implemented_ by the running EVL core, from the application side.

- state which revision of the ABI an application _requires_.

In some instance, the EVL core may also be able to provide a
backward-compatible interface to applications which spans multiple
subsequent ABI revisions. Because **ABI stability is a strong goal**,
backward compatibility may become the norm as the EVL core feature set
stabilizes.

To this end, the following apply (since ABI revision #19):

- an ABI is versioned. Each version is represented by a non-null
  integer starting at 1, incremented by one after each revision.

- the EVL core defines two symbols, namely
  [EVL_ABI_BASE](https://git.evlproject.org/linux-evl.git/tree/include/uapi/evl/control.h?h=evl/master)
  and
  [EVL_ABI_LEVEL](https://git.evlproject.org/linux-evl.git/tree/include/uapi/evl/control.h?h=evl/master),
  which represent the range of ABI revisions the core supports
  (inclusively), from oldest (EVL_ABI_BASE) to current (EVL_ABI_LEVEL)
  respectively. Differing values means that the EVL core honors
  multiple subsequent revisions by way of backward compatible support
  of some sort.

{{% notice tip %}}
By convention, changes to EVL_ABI_BASE and/or
EVL_ABI_LEVEL belong to the same GIT commit which triggered the ABI
revision. This way, it is easy to map a revision to a particular
change unambiguously. For the same reason, non-related changes to the
ABI appear in separate commits, each one forming a particular ABI
revision.

- [libevl]({{< relref "core/user-api/_index.md" >}}) states the ABI
  revision it follows by defining the
  [EVL_ABI_PREREQ](https://git.evlproject.org/libevl.git/tree/include/evl/evl.h?h=master)
  symbol. When [libevl initializes]({{< relref
  "core/user-api/init/_index.md" >}}), this prerequisite is checked
  against the range of ABI revisions the running EVL core
  advertises. If a mismatch is detected, the initialization fails and
  -ENOEXEC is returned to the caller; otherwise the execution proceeds
  normally. An easy way to figure out which ABI a [libevl]({{< relref
  "core/user-api/_index.md" >}}) installation requires is to ask the
  [evl command]({{< relref "core/commands.md" >}}) about it as
  follows:

  ```
  ~ # evl -V
  evl.0 -- #1c6115c (2020-03-06 16:24:00 +0100) [requires ABI 19]
  ```

#### Locating ABI boundaries and prereqs {git-evlabi}

When developing (with) the EVL core, it may sometimes be useful to
find which code changes in the GIT commit history correspond to ABI
revisions and conversely. It may also be useful to determine the
history of ABI prerequisites in [libevl]({{< relref
"core/user-api/_index.md" >}}), so that you can map any particular
point the commit history with the ABI revision it is compatible
with. For this, you can use a simple script called
[git-evlabi](https://git.evlproject.org/linux-evl.git/tree/scripts/git-evlabi?h=evl/master),
which is available in the
[linux-evl](https://git.evlproject.org/linux-evl.git) repository. You
just need to make sure this script is executable and reachable from
the $PATH variable.

git-evlabi looks for EVL ABI definitions or prereqs in GIT trees
cloned from either
[linux-evl](https://git.evlproject.org/linux-evl.git) or
[libevl](https://git.evlproject.org/libevl.git) respectively. It does
so depending on the value and type of the GIT object mentioned (or
not) in the command:

```
$ git evlabi -h
usage: git-evlabi [-r <rev>][--git-dir <dir>][-s][-h] [<object>]
```

- if \<object\> is a regular commit (SHA-1) hash, it extracts the ABI
  information for that particular commit.

- if \<object\> matches a GIT refname (typically a branch name), it
  scans the commit history backward from that point, displaying the
  ABI information for each revision encountered during the traversal.

- if \<object\> is omitted, it defaults to HEAD, which falls back to
  the refname case above.

The output is of the form:

  \<start\> \<range\> \<revision\>  [\<shortlog\>], where:

  - \<start\> is the predecessor of the earliest commit
    implementing/requesting the ABI revision
    
  - \<range\> is the span of the ABI revision in the history (usable
    with _git log_ for instance).
    
  - \<revision\> is the ABI revision number
    
  - \<shortlog\> is the subject line describing \<start\>

With the information above, it is easy to figure out the span of a
given ABI revision in the kernel code (here ABI 17 starting at commit
#c2a51a7e68a7), as follows:

> e.g. looking for span of ABI 17 in the kernel tree
```
{rpm@cobalt} git log --oneline 56e217799766..7f082bc5bef1
7f082bc5bef1 evl/work: export interface to modules
54b365d416c7 evl/stax: export interface to modules
c268cadb0396 evl/stax: force the caller to in-band mode on WOSX
77d1de6add6e evl/clock: y2038: remove use of struct timex
05fc1d0e5e96 evl/thread: fix rescheduling leak
c2a51a7e68a7 evl/thread: replace SIGEVL_ACTION_HOME with a RETUSER event
```

The same logic applies to the
[libevl](https://git.evlproject.org/libevl.git) tree, this time for
determining the ABI prerequisites of commits in the API.

> e.g. walking the history of ABI prerequisites
```
{rpm@cobalt} git evlabi next
dde33b5 1c6115c..dde33b5  19  
```

Which means that looking at the current state of branch _next_ in the
[libevl](https://git.evlproject.org/libevl.git) tree, ABI revision 19
in the EVL core starts being a prerequisite for the code starting at
commit #dde33b5.

Conversely, you could ask for matching a particular ABI revision to a
commit, using the -r switch.

> e.g. matching a particular ABI revision (asking for the subject line too)
```
{rpm@cobalt} git evlabi -r 16 -s
5266e26ca729 857c199beead..56e217799766  16  evl: introduce synchronous breakpoint support
```

{{% notice info %}}
git-evlabi cannot detect ABI revisions earlier than 19 in the
[libevl](https://git.evlproject.org/libevl.git) tree, since the
marker it looks for was introduced by that particular revision.
