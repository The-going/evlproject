- irq_work should be documented in the kernel API

- porting->developers notes are obsolete, they should refer to altsched in some
  cases. Altsched should also document the behavior with CPU_IDLE.

- in Dovetail->porting->interrupt flow: use a different
  color/shape/convention in the mermaid chart for what needs to be
  ported vs what is generic code.

- all mermaid chart should mention the meaning of colors via some
  caption.

- the "under the hood" code for proxy ticks needs to be converted to a
  mermaid diagram.

- should we add an external link for each C routine present in the
  kernel, picked from some arbitrary kernel release from some LXR
  site? Could we just use a link to git.evenless.org/file+line of some
  sort?
