- the porting doc is right in the sense that a port can mean:
  1) porting to a different kernel release, so we want to know about
     the generic stuff as well
  2) porting to a different arch, so we specifically want to know
     about the arch-specific bits.

  What about replacing "porting" by "implementation" detailing each
  sections as currently, then have "arch ports" as a single page
  detailing the general porting process to a new arch exclusively (not
  the generic stuff), with links to the "implementation" sections?

- porting->developers notes are obsolete, they should refer to altsched in some
  cases. Altsched should also document the behavior with CPU_IDLE.

- in Dovetail->porting->interrupt flow: use a different
  color/shape/convention in the mermaid chart for what needs to be
  ported vs what is generic code.

- all mermaid chart should mention the meaning of colors via some
  caption.

- the "under the hood" code for proxy ticks needs to be converted to a
  mermaid diagram.

- should we add an external link for each C routine present in the
  kernel, picked from some arbitrary kernel release from some LXR
  site? Could we just use a link to git.evenless.org/file+line of some
  sort?
